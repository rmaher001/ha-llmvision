# Test Images

Place test images in `/config/www/test_images/`:
- `tow_truck.jpg` - Image of a tow truck for testing

Copy this directory to `/config/www/test_images/` in your Home Assistant installation.

When test mode is enabled, the AI will analyze `tow_truck.jpg` instead of the live camera feed.
